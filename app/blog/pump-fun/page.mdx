Pump.fun, a Solana-based meme token launch platform, was exploited on May 15, 2024, when a former employee used their privileged access and a flash loan attack to drain ~$1.9 million (~12.3K SOL) from the bonding curve liquidity pools.

## Why would you use Pump.fun?
Pump.fun is a platform that allows users to easily create, launch, and trade Solana-based meme tokens using bonding curves. These curves automatically adjust the token price as users buy or sell.
Users can:
- Create tokens instantly
- Buy low, sell high as token demand increases
- Trade directly within the platform through smart contracts

The simplicity and hype around meme coins made it a hotspot for rapid speculation and growth.

Before understanding how the hack worked, you first need to understand what flash loans are.

## What are Flash Loans?

A flash loan is an uncollateralized loan that allows someone to borrow large amounts of cryptocurrency for the duration of a single transaction — but it must be repaid before the transaction ends. If not, the transaction is automatically canceled and reverted.

This feature is unique to blockchain environments that support atomic transactions, like Ethereum and Solana.

Example:
1. Borrow 10,000 SOL via a flash loan.
2. Use it to exploit a vulnerable protocol or gain arbitrage profits.
3. Repay the 10,000 SOL within the same block.
4. If anything fails — the entire transaction gets reverted, and it's like it never happened.

## How did the Hacker Steal Funds?
A high-level overview of the strategy executed by the attacker:
1. Used internal access to control the withdrawal authority.
2. Borrowed SOL via a flash loan.
3. Used that SOL to buy as many coins as possible to push them to 100% bonding curve completion.
4. Drained the bonding curve liquidity upon reaching 100%.
5. Repaid the flash loan and walked away with profits.

Let us walk you through an example of how this worked:
- The attacker took a flash loan to borrow a large amount of SOL.
- They used the SOL to aggressively buy newly launched tokens on Pump.fun.
- Once tokens reached 100% bonding curve completion, the smart contracts allowed liquidity withdrawal.
- The attacker instantly withdrew the liquidity (mostly SOL).
- Used part of the stolen funds to repay the flash loan.
- Retained the rest as profit.

## Technical Concepts:
To understand how the exploit happened, we must review some foundational elements:
1. Pump.fun: The main protocol, which uses bonding curves for token pricing.
2. Flash Loans: Loans that require no collateral if repaid in a single transaction.
3. Bonding Curve Liquidity: When 100% of tokens are bought, the liquidity pool becomes withdrawable.
4. Privileged Access: The attacker used previously granted access (withdraw authority) to enable fund transfers.

## Technical Explanation:
1. At 15:21 UTC, the attacker began initiating flash loans and using previously held withdraw permissions.
2. They targeted coins that were nearing 100% bonding curve status.
3. For each coin:
    - Borrowed SOL via a flash loan.
    - Bought the token rapidly using the SOL to drive it to 100%.
    - Used withdraw authority to drain the SOL from the bonding curve contract.
    - Repaid the flash loan within the same transaction.
4. This process was repeated across multiple tokens between 15:21–17:00 UTC.

## What was the damage?
- ~12.3K SOL stolen (worth ~$1.9 million).
- ~20–30 coins affected (exact number may vary).
- Out of ~$45 million in bonded liquidity, only ~$1.9M affected.


## Pump.fun Response and Mitigation
- Trading Paused at 17:00 UTC.
- New Contracts Deployed – Platform was restarted with new secure contracts.
- 0% Trading Fees for 7 days post-relaunch.
- Token Recovery Plan:
    - Affected tokens (those that reached 100% between 15:21–17:00 UTC) will be re-launched on Raydium.
    - Each token will be seeded with equal or more SOL liquidity.
