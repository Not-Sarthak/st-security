## What was FTX?
FTX was a Bahamas-based cryptocurrency exchange founded in 2019 by Sam Bankman-Fried and Gary Wang. At its peak, FTX was the third-largest crypto exchange by volume, boasting over one million users and a valuation of $32 billion. It was lauded for its innovative trading products and rapid growth.

To fully grasp the intricacies of the FTX collapse, it's essential to understand the following concepts:
1. **Centralized Exchanges (CEX)**: Platforms where users can buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies. They can be centralized (CEX) or decentralized (DEX). FTX was a centralized exchange, meaning it had control over users' funds and operations.
2. **Alameda Research**: A quantitative cryptocurrency trading firm also founded by Sam Bankman-Fried. Alameda had close ties with FTX, and their intertwined operations played a significant role in the collapse.
3. **FTT Token**: FTX's native cryptocurrency, used for trading fee discounts and other benefits on the platform. FTT's value and liquidity were central to FTX's financial stability.

## The Rise and Fall of FTX

The popularity of cryptocurrency exchange platform FTX rose rapidly after it was launched in 2019. However, FTX came crashing down in November 2022, resulting in one of the largest fraud cases in crypto history.

Until late 2022, FTX was one of the leading cryptocurrency trading platforms. Sam Bankman-Fried started FTX in 2019, and customers quickly began opening accounts to trade and buy cryptocurrency. Top venture capital investors poured in significant funding, and by January 2022, the company was valued at an impressive $32 billion.

This success story ended abruptly in November 2022. What initially appeared to be an accounting oversight turned out to be major fraud, resulting in billions of dollars in losses for customers and investors. Investigators discovered that customer funds were being diverted to accounts controlled by Alameda Research—a cryptocurrency trading firm headquartered in Hong Kong—instead of being properly secured by FTX. This revelation triggered FTX's rapid collapse.

## What Made FTX Popular?

FTX was one of the largest digital currency exchange platforms for buying and selling cryptocurrencies. As cryptocurrency investments grew in popularity, users were attracted to these platforms because they provided digital wallets to store cryptocurrencies directly in personal accounts. Customers could alternatively store cryptocurrencies in their own crypto wallets using software or hardware solutions independent of the platform.

## The Growth Strategy of FTX

Soon after its inception, FTX quickly rose to dominate its market through several strategic moves:

1. **Strategic Acquisitions**: FTX acquired struggling competitors such as Liquid Global, LedgerX, and Blockfolio.
2. **Aggressive Marketing**: The company launched high-profile marketing campaigns including Super Bowl advertisements, celebrity endorsements, and securing naming rights to the Miami Heat's arena.
3. **Attractive Yields**: Marketing campaigns promised customers they could deposit funds in FTX accounts and earn significantly higher yields than traditional banking offered.

Cryptocurrency markets boomed in early 2021, with Bitcoin reaching a peak of $64,000, up from $10,000. This market frenzy attracted more customers to FTX, while venture capital groups invested nearly $2 billion in the company.

## The FTT Token

Cryptocurrency platforms often create their own tokens to attract new customers and create additional revenue streams. As more people invest in these tokens, their value typically increases, allowing platforms to offer various perks to token holders.

FTX created its native digital token called FTT in May 2019. The exchange offered various benefits for "staking" FTT (holding it in dedicated accounts), including trading fee discounts and NFT rewards.

## The Downfall of FTX

In late 2021 and early 2022, Bitcoin's price began declining significantly from its peak, with other cryptocurrencies following suit. Many major platforms started shutting down, but FTX appeared to weather the storm and continued acquiring competitors.

However, FTX's façade of stability crumbled in November 2022 when [CoinDesk published an article](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/11/02/divisions-in-sam-bankman-frieds-crypto-empire-blur-on-his-trading-titan-alamedas-balance-sheet/) revealing that Alameda Research—also founded by Bankman-Fried—was heavily dependent on FTX's digital token FTT, with assets valued at $5 billion. Soon after, FTX's balance sheet was leaked, exposing a severe lack of diversification and dangerous interdependence between the two companies. The balance sheet showed $9 billion in liabilities against just $900 million in assets, with poorly labeled entries revealing a negative $8 billion balance.

Investigators later discovered that Alameda had been borrowing virtually unlimited capital from FTX. This funding came primarily from customer deposits, with the trading firm routinely borrowing money directly from FTX customer assets.

## Financial Mismanagement and Lack of Oversight

FTX and its associated companies failed to produce standard balance sheets showing assets and liabilities—a fundamental financial reporting procedure. FTX's financial statements were never properly audited because it operated as a private company. Without these audits, there was no verifiable record of cash flow or assets to demonstrate the company could cover its liabilities or customer deposits. The limited balance sheets that did exist showed assets far below what Bankman-Fried had publicly claimed.

## The Failed Binance Acquisition

[Binance](https://www.binance.com/), a competing cryptocurrency exchange platform, initially agreed to acquire FTX on November 8, 2022, before the full extent of its problems became public. Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance, had been one of FTX's earliest investors. However, the deal collapsed within 24 hours, with Binance [citing on Twitter](https://x.com/binance/status/1590449161069268992?t=vm7KxwNRbwAvAiOWefJrRw&s=19) the mishandling of customer funds and ongoing U.S. investigations as reasons for abandoning the acquisition.

## The 10-Day Collapse

FTX's collapse unfolded over just 10 days in November 2022:

- **November 2**: CoinDesk published its article revealing Alameda's heavy dependence on FTT tokens
- **November 6**: Binance announced it would liquidate its FTT holdings due to concerns about mishandled and commingled funds
- **November 7-8**: FTT's value plummeted, triggering a wave of customer withdrawals from FTX
- **November 8**: FTX blocked customer withdrawals by removing the option from its platform, leaving hundreds of thousands of customers unable to access their funds
- **November 8 (later)**: Binance announced a non-binding agreement to acquire FTX
- **November 9**: Binance abandoned the acquisition after initial due diligence
- **November 11**: FTX filed for bankruptcy when it could not cover the $8 billion gap between customer assets and available funds
- **November 12**: Authorities began investigating potential criminal misconduct

During this period, Bankman-Fried reportedly ordered Alameda Research to sell assets to cover withdrawal demands while also seeking emergency financing to address the growing deficit.

Subsequent investigations revealed that Bankman-Fried had used FTX funds to purchase personal luxury items, finance elaborate advertising campaigns, and make substantial political donations.

## Criminal Charges and Lawsuits
<Image src="/content/ftx/ftx3.png" alt="FTX Fraud" width={500} height={500} className="mx-auto" />

Authorities arrested Bankman-Fried on December 12, 2022, on multiple fraud charges related to FTX. The U.S. District Court indicted him on eight criminal charges, including:

1. Money laundering
2. Wire fraud (multiple counts)
3. Campaign finance violations
4. Securities fraud

Bankman-Fried was released on a $250 million bond—the largest in U.S. history.

By January 2023, bankruptcy administrators had recovered approximately $5 billion in cash and liquid assets, though the total assets missing were estimated at $8 billion.

FTX investors filed a [class action lawsuit](https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/ftx-hit-with-class-action-lawsuit-celebrities-endorsed-crypto-exchange-2022-11-16/) against FTX and its celebrity endorsers on November 15, 2022. The civil suit alleged that FTX used "false representation and deceptive conduct." The lawsuit also accused FTX of operating a Ponzi scheme to misuse customer funds and improperly move money between different corporate entities.

## Market Impact

While overall demand for cryptocurrency declined following the FTX scandal, Bitcoin demonstrated resilience, recovering to values above $21,000 by January 2023. This represented a significant rebound from values below $16,000 in November 2022 when the FTX news was breaking.

The FTX collapse prompted the Securities and Exchange Commission and U.S. Congress to plan discussions on strengthening regulations for the cryptocurrency industry. The case highlighted a critical difference between cryptocurrency exchanges and traditional financial institutions: when a cryptocurrency exchange files for bankruptcy, customer deposits have no government insurance protection, unlike U.S. banks where the FDIC insures funds up to certain limits.

The scandal's ripple effects spread throughout the crypto industry. Genesis, a major cryptocurrency lender, filed for bankruptcy on January 20, 2023, owing creditors nearly $3.4 billion after the cryptocurrency market downturn triggered by the FTX collapse.

The broader consequences for the cryptocurrency market remain uncertain, but this massive collapse—one of the largest in cryptocurrency's relatively short history—may significantly deter future investors, particularly institutional ones concerned about regulatory risks.

## FTX Debtors' Report

On April 9, 2023, FTX debtors released their [first comprehensive report](https://cases.ra.kroll.com/FTX/Home-DocketInfo) detailing the failures of FTX Group's management team prior to bankruptcy. "The FTX Group lacked appropriate management, governance and organizational structure," the report stated.

Key findings included:

**Security Failures:**
- Private keys to move crypto assets often left in unencrypted files
- Crypto assets left unsecured in "hot wallets" connected to the internet
- Failure to implement multifactor authentication in critical systems
- Multiple individuals having access to wallets containing billions of dollars in crypto assets

**Financial Control Deficiencies:**
- Lack of experienced personnel to handle financial reporting, risk management, audits, or accounting procedures
- Most financial policies were either generic or nonexistent despite the firm handling significant financial assets
- No formal protocols for intercompany transactions, allowing assets and liabilities to transfer between insiders and FTX Group entities without documentation or controls

## Legal Action Against Bankman-Fried's Parents

FTX is [suing Bankman-Fried's parents](https://www.reuters.com/legal/bankrupt-ftx-sues-sam-bankman-frieds-parents-recover-millions-dollars-2023-09-19/) on suspicion of embezzling millions of dollars from the business for personal gain and "pet causes." The lawsuit was filed on September 18, 2023.

The corporation is seeking to recover funds that Bankman-Fried's parents allegedly fraudulently transferred and misappropriated from the company.

The lawsuit alleges that Joe Bankman and Barbara Fried—both tenured Stanford law professors—either knew of or deliberately ignored clear signs of fraud perpetrated by their son and his associates at FTX.

The lawsuit contains several specific allegations:
- Barbara Fried allegedly encouraged her son to circumvent federal campaign finance disclosure rules
- She reportedly discussed the transfer of Bankman-Fried's home in the Bahamas along with a $10 million cash gift
- Joe Bankman allegedly attempted to conceal a whistleblower complaint filed in 2019

## Bankman-Fried's Conviction and Sentencing

On November 2, 2023, Bankman-Fried was [found guilty on all seven federal counts](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/ftx-founder-samuel-bankman-fried-convicted-fraud-conspiracy-and-money-laundering-offenses) brought against him. He was convicted of:

1. Two counts of wire fraud conspiracy
2. Two counts of wire fraud
3. One count of conspiracy to commit money laundering
4. One count of conspiracy to commit commodities fraud
5. One count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud

On March 28, 2024, Bankman-Fried was [sentenced to 25 years in federal prison](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/ftx-founder-samuel-bankman-fried-sentenced-25-years-prison-fraud-conspiracy-and-money)—significantly shorter than the 40-50 year sentence that prosecutors had requested. In addition to imprisonment, he was ordered to pay more than $11 billion in forfeiture.

## FTX Bankruptcy Resolution

On January 31, 2024, FTX [announced](https://www.reuters.com/technology/bankrupt-crypto-exchange-ftx-abandon-relaunch-efforts-liquidate-2024-01-31/) it would not restart its cryptocurrency exchange operations. Instead, the company opted to liquidate all assets and return the proceeds to customers.

The exchange had been in negotiations for months with potential investors and bidders but failed to secure sufficient funding to rebuild its operations.

On October 7, 2024, a Delaware bankruptcy judge approved FTX's reorganization plan. This plan will provide 98% of FTX's creditors with 119% of their allowed claims as of November 2022—when the platform initially received bankruptcy protection.

Since filing for bankruptcy, FTX has recovered nearly $16 billion to repay its customers.

## Reduced Sentences for Cooperating Executives

Two convicted FTX executives are expected to be released from prison ahead of their originally scheduled dates:

1. **Ryan Salame** was initially sentenced to 7.5 years for his role in the FTX scandal. The Federal Bureau of Prisons has revised his release date to March 1, 2031—more than a year earlier than his original April 2032 release date.

2. **Caroline Ellison**, who served as CEO of Alameda Research, was sentenced to two years after pleading guilty to seven federal counts of fraud and conspiracy. Ellison was a key witness in the case against Bankman-Fried. Her release date has been moved up by approximately three months.
