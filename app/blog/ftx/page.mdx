## What was FTX?
FTX was a Bahamas-based cryptocurrency exchange founded in 2019 by Sam Bankman-Fried and Gary Wang. At its peak, FTX was the third-largest crypto exchange by volume, boasting over one million users and a valuation of $32 billion. It was lauded for its innovative trading products and rapid growth.

To fully grasp the intricacies of the FTX collapse, it's essential to understand the following concepts:
1. Centralized Exchanges (CEX): Platforms where users can buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies. They can be centralized (CEX) or decentralized (DEX). FTX was a centralized exchange, meaning it had control over users' funds and operations.
2. Alameda Research: A quantitative cryptocurrency trading firm also founded by Sam Bankman-Fried. Alameda had close ties with FTX, and their intertwined operations played a significant role in the collapse.
3. FTT Token: FTX's native cryptocurrency, used for trading fee discounts and other benefits on the platform. FTT's value and liquidity were central to FTX's financial stability.​

## Summary of the Collapse
In early November 2022, a CoinDesk report revealed that Alameda Research's balance sheet was heavily reliant on FTT tokens, raising concerns about the firm's financial health. This led Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao to announce the liquidation of Binance's FTT holdings, triggering a massive sell-off. FTX experienced withdrawals of around $5 billion, roughly 50 times its typical daily flows, and was unable to meet demands, causing its collapse. ​
