Solareum, a Telegram-based crypto trading bot built on the Solana blockchain, [permanently shut down](https://x.com/SolareumProject/status/1773744784387064265) following a $1 million exploit and ongoing financial instability.

The breach exposed deep-rooted vulnerabilities in the bot&apos;s infrastructure, ultimately leading to stolen user funds, frozen assets, and the platform&apos;s abrupt closure. A subsequent investigation revealed the involvement of a North Korean IT worker hired by the Solareum team — a major operational and security oversight.

## Why would you use Solareum?

Solareum offered a simple, fast, and accessible way to trade Solana (SOL) tokens directly through Telegram. It targeted non-technical users by removing the complexity of traditional trading interfaces.
Key advantages:
- No need for external wallets or dApps
- Fast execution of trades
- Simple interface through a widely-used messaging platform (Telegram)
However, ease of use came at the cost of poor security practices.

## How did the Breach Unfold?
- March 29, 2024: Hundreds of users reported sudden losses from their wallets on Telegram and X (Twitter).
- User reports included:
    - “All of my SOL and tokens hacked.”
    - “Wallet is drained.”
    - “How do I get a refund?”
- One user claimed to have lost $30,000, another over $200,000. In total, 6,045 SOL were stolen, worth approximately $1.4 million.
- Solareum initially suggested a system exploit but later clarified there was an external factor involved.
- January 2025: A U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filing revealed the likely cause — a North Korean developer had infiltrated the team and inserted malicious code into the platform.

## How did the hacker steal funds?
### Attack Timeline
- March 29, 2024: Users began reporting missing funds on Solareum’s Telegram support channel and across social media platforms. Reports showed drained SOL balances and unauthorized transactions being executed from user wallets.
- March 30, 2024: After coordinated efforts from the security community, including researchers like Taylor Monahan, Tether was contacted to freeze the USDT linked to laundering routes. Tether successfully froze a large portion of the funds.
- May 2024: The FBI announced the seizure of approximately $950,000 USDT. The funds had been partially moved through centralized exchanges before being frozen.

### Method of Attack
1. Malicious Code Injection by Internal Developer
    - A new developer hired in December 2023 embedded malicious code into the Solareum bot backend.
    - This code allowed backend access to user wallet authorization logic.
    - The code may have intercepted wallet seed phrases or private keys, or manipulated signing prompts.

2. Telegram-Based Bot Exploitation
    - Solareum executed trades using Telegram as the interface.
    - The attack leveraged Telegram messages to prompt transactions or bypassed the need for user confirmation entirely.
    - Users may have unknowingly interacted with malicious command flows, enabling unauthorized withdrawals.

3. Wallet Drain
    - Draining targeted only SOL tokens, not SPL (Solana Program Library) tokens.
    - ~2,808 SOL were confirmed stolen initially, with further tracking estimating total losses to exceed 6,000 SOL from more than 300 users.

4. Laundering Path
    - The attacker converted SOL into USDT (Tether).
    - The USDT was then moved across multiple crypto exchanges to obfuscate the origin:
        - Binance
        - MEXC
        - HTX
        - EasyBit
        - FixedFloat

5. On-Chain Pattern Matching
    - Security researchers observed transaction behavior consistent with prior DPRK-attributed attacks.

6. Tether Freeze & FBI Seizure
    - After Monahan and others provided enough trace data, Tether froze the wallets holding USDT.
    - The FBI then moved in to seize ~$950,000 USDT, recovering a major portion of the stolen funds

## What was the Impact?
- 302 wallets drained; 2,808 SOL lost (~$520,000).
- Additional 3,200+ SOL stolen across related accounts.
- Victims unable to recover assets unless exchanges cooperated.
- Solareum ceased operations within 24 hours of the exploit.
