Nirvana vision is to build an investment protocol for a sustainable store of wealth.

It primarily built 2 tokens:

$ANA - partially collateralized volatile token
$NIRV - a stablecoin pegged to 1 $USD
The hacker was able to drain Nirvana's treasury for $3.5 million.

Draining this treasury - which acts as collateral to back the value of $ANA and $NIRV - led to their market capitalizing tanking and user's holding either of these tokens combined lost greater than $10M ðŸ˜­

Let's deep dive on how the hacker was able to exploit the treasury.

## Why would you use Nirvana Protocol?
We mention above that Nirvana builds two tokens $ANA and $NIRV.
1. $ANA token:
    - Aimed to become a store of wealth for users.
    - It utilizes a form of protocol owned liquidity where the protocol would guarantee a minimum floor price of the token.

2. $NIRV token:
    - A stablecoin that get's stabilized using $ANA. Similar to how the Terra project stabilized the stablecoin $UST using the volatile token $LUNA.
    - It get's minted by taking a collateralized loan in $ANA. Similar to how $DAI get's minted by providing collateral in $ETH

## How did the Hacker Steal Funds?

Before explaining the hack, we need some pre-requisite knowledge about how $ANA get's created:
- Nirvana has built out a virtual AMM and it utilizes it to control the supply of $ANA.
<Image src="/content/nirvana/nirvana2.png" alt="Nirvana" width={500} height={500} className="mx-auto" />
- New $ANA get's minted when user's purchase it from the protocol by sending stablecoins directly to Nirvana's treasury. These stablecoins then remain in the treasury to support the floor price of $ANA.
- $ANA get's burned out of circulation when you sell it back to Nirvana in exchange for stablecoins.
- The documentation is not very specific on the price curve of $ANA though you can read more about how $ANA's price is determined [here](https://docs.nirvana.finance/introduction).

Now that we know how $ANA get's minted, let's see how the hacker drained the protocol's treasury.
- The exploit in Nirvana resulted from an inaccurate pricing for the ANA token.
- The hacker was able to artificially inflate the price of $ANA from $8 to $24
    - The hacker takes a $10M flashloan
    - Buys 1.17M $ANA using that $10M
    - Since the act of purchasing $ANA from Nirvanaâ€™s native AMM pushes the price upward, the hacker exploited the price curve logic to inflate the price of $ANA abnormally.
    - Then he sold the overpriced $ANA back to the Nirvana netting the exploiter ~$3.5M in profit, on top of the flash loaned amount.

The flow of attack would have looked like this:

1. Before attacker's tx got executed:
    - Nirvana treasury had: ~$3.5 million worth of stables.
    - price of $ANA: $8
2. Hacker then takes a flashloan from Solend and buys ANA:
    - Now Nirvana treasury had: $3.5M + $10M worth of stables.
    - price of $ANA: $24
3. Hacker sells overpriced $ANA back to the protocol
    - Nirvana sends all it's treasury ($3.5 million + $10M from flashloan) back to hacker.
4. Hacker then closes flashloan by sending $10M back to Solend.

But the hack was not just limited to $3.5 worth of lost assets.

From [Nirvana's official Post Mortem]:
>What makes this theft unusual is the asymmetry between what the hacker gained, and what Nirvana investors lost. Unlike a typical theft, where the amount stolen is equal to the amount lost by the victims, the damage to investors is many times greater than what was stolen. Though the hacker walked away with 3.5M USDT, the entire market capitalization of NIRV & ANA would algorithmically cease to function without this reserve capital, causing well over $10M of lost assets. The reason for this asymmetry is that much of NIRV & ANA was leveraged, and requires the grounding collateral beneath these positions.

It is like the lower floor of a tower was removed, causing the entire structure to fall

## Technical Details:
Hacker Address: [76w4SBe2of2wWUsx2FjkkwD29rRznfvEkBa1upSbTAWH](https://solscan.io/account/76w4SBe2of2wWUsx2FjkkwD29rRznfvEkBa1upSbTAWH)
1. Hacker first creates a new account to upload their program:

2. Then executes the [attack tx](https://solana.fm/tx/LyUnvdY9KBQiVRFqmSzGUfCuPGqYX1xNHCWLWxWZ4MvgLcNis2Kui6T25Ayai5UzpTAFkSRSgriKb3pM8tAoeR5?cluster=mainnet-alpha) via the above account. Takes flash loan of 10,250,000 USDC from Solend

3. Manipulated price from $8 to $24 by executing Buy3 instruction to buy 1.17M from the above USDC

4. Calls two Swap instructions:
    - Swap 153,524.98 ANA for ~3.49M USDT

    - Swap 624,284.63 ANA for ~10.29M USDC
