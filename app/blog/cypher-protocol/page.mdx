On August 7th, 2023, Cypher Protocol was exploited for approximately $1 million. The attacker uncovered bugs in the protocol's isolated margin sub-accounts system, allowing them to borrow more funds than their collateral should permit.

## Why would you use Cypher Protocol?

Cypher Protocol is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on Solana, offering an advanced trading platform for tokens and derivatives. Unlike typical DEXs, Cypher provides sophisticated margin trading features with lending and borrowing capabilities that generate revenue for liquidity providers.

The platform stands out for its complex and detailed interface, making it a preferred choice for experienced traders seeking advanced trading functionalities in the Solana ecosystem.

## How did the Hacker Steal Funds?

The Cypher Protocol enables marginal lending, borrowing, and trading. The protocol is structured so that a primary user account — called CypherAccounts — can have multiple attached CypherSubAccounts. The primary account caches data associated with each of its sub-accounts.

By default, all sub-accounts are cross-collateralized with the master account, allowing a deposit in one to be used as collateral for borrowing from another. The protocol allows a sub-account to be isolated — disabling this functionality — but an error in the code when switching to an isolated state caused the master account not to track this change properly.

Another critical error in the code dealt with margin checks before allowing a borrow. This flaw, combined with the fact that oracle price feeds were not yet fully activated, allowed the attacker to perform borrows when they should have been rejected by the system.

The attacker exploited these vulnerabilities using multiple primary accounts to drain approximately $1 million in various assets from the Cypher Protocol.

## Post-Exploit Response

After discovering the exploit, Cypher Protocol immediately froze its smart contract to prevent further theft. The team reached out to the attacker in an attempt to negotiate the return of stolen funds.

According to blockchain explorer data, the wallet suspected to be tied to the exploit stole approximately:
- 15,452 SOL
- 14,675 jitoSOL
- 8,750 mSOL
- 1 wETH
- 149,205 USDC
- Small amounts of other tokens

In the hours following the exploit, the alleged wallet transferred 30,000 USDC to Binance's Solana USDC address "kiing.sol" in a possible attempt to cash out the stolen funds.

Community members responded by sending NFTs to the attacker's wallet with messages requesting the return of funds. One message read: "Seriously though, you used Binance and KuCoin to fund and to try and get 30k out. People will find you. Please do the right thing and give the rest back."

## Incident & Response Timeline

- **2:18 pm UTC** - The attacker makes the first deposit into Cypher of 0.1 USDC
- **3:04 pm UTC** - The attacker successfully exploits the protocol using the first master account created, leaving the system with ~$1.925 of bad debt
- **3:04 pm - 6:29 pm UTC** - The attacker proceeds to create 15 different master accounts and repeats the same steps, starting with larger deposits to withdraw greater amounts
- **6:15 pm UTC** - The team notices unusually large amounts of borrows across multiple assets (some triggering borrow caps that prevented pools from being entirely drained) and begins investigating internally
- **6:31 pm UTC** - The team becomes aware of an unknown attack vector and mobilizes to halt pools and contact relevant parties
- **7:47 pm UTC** - The contract is frozen to prevent further asset theft and stop users from depositing
- **7:59 pm UTC** - The community is notified via a public announcement of the exploit

From this point, all efforts were dedicated to tracking funds, identifying the attacker, and uncovering all issues related to the attack vector.

## Technical Explanation

The Cypher program has multiple types of user accounts that store data and enable functionalities like lending, borrowing, and margin trading. The primary accounts, named in code as **CypherAccount** (master account) and **CypherSubAccount** (sub-account), work together to make the system function.

The master account acts as a cache for every sub-account linked to it. Data from each sub-account—including assets value, liabilities value, and collateral ratio—is cached within the master account whenever a user interacts with the program. Here's how these accounts are structured:

```rust
#[assert_size(aligns, 128)]
#[zero_copy(unsafe)]
#[derive(PartialEq)]
pub struct SubAccountCache {
    /// the value of the assets of this account
    pub assets_value: i128, // 16
    /// the value of the liabilities of this account
    pub liabilities_value: i128, // 32
    /// the margin c-ratio of this sub account
    pub c_ratio: i128, // 48
    /// slot of the last cache update
    pub updated_at: u64, // 56
    /// the sub account margining
    pub margining: SubAccountMargining, // 57
    _padding: [u8; 7], // 64
    /// the sub account
    pub sub_account: Pubkey, // 96
    /// the value of volatile assets of this account
    pub volatile_assets_value: i128, // 112
    /// the value of volatile liabilities of this account
    pub volatile_liabilities_value: i128, // 128
}

#[assert_size(aligns, 3200)]
#[account(zero_copy(unsafe))]
pub struct CypherAccount {
    /// the bump seed
    pub bump_seed: [u8; 1], // 1
    /// the account number seed
    pub account_number_seed: [u8; 1], // 2
    /// the account type
    pub account_type: AccountType, // 3
    /// the fee tier of this account
    pub fee_tier: u8, // 4
    _padding: [u8; 12], // 16

    /// the clearing this account belongs to
    pub clearing: Pubkey, // 48
    /// the account's authority, should match sub accounts authority
    pub authority: Pubkey, // 80
    /// the account's delegate
    pub delegate: Pubkey, // 112
    /// the sub account cache
    pub sub_account_caches: [SubAccountCache; 24], // 3184 - occupies 3072 bytes
    /// slot of the last account update
    pub updated_at: u64, // 3192
    _padding2: [u8; 8], // 3200
}

#[assert_size(aligns, 5632)]
#[account(zero_copy(unsafe))]
pub struct CypherSubAccount {
    /// the bump seed
    pub bump_seed: [u8; 1], // 1
    /// the account number seed
    pub account_number_seed: [u8; 1], // 2

    /// the margining type of this account
    pub margining_type: SubAccountMargining, // 3
    _padding: [u8; 13], // 16

    /// the alias of the account
    pub account_alias: [u8; 32], // 48

    /// the associated clearing
    pub clearing: Pubkey, // 80
    /// the master account
    pub master_account: Pubkey, // 112
    /// the authority
    pub authority: Pubkey, // 144
    /// the delegate
    pub delegate: Pubkey, // 176
    /// the slot of the last update of this account
    pub updated_at: u64, // 184
    /// the amount of claimable liquidity mining rewards
    pub claimable_rewards: u64, // 192
    _padding2: [u64; 7], // 248
    _padding3: [u8; 8],  // 256

    /// the positions of this sub account
    pub positions: [PositionSlot; 24], // 5632 - occupies 5376 bytes
}
```

By default, any sub-account created is cross-collateralized within the master account. This means users can deposit assets into one sub-account and borrow using a different one. This feature requires a specific instruction called **UpdateAccountMargin** to cache the state of sub-accounts within the master account, which was visible in the attacker's transactions.

To allow sub-accounts to be margined separately (isolated margining), an enumerator is stored within both the sub-account and its cache in the master account:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, AnchorDeserialize, AnchorSerialize, PartialEq)]
pub enum SubAccountMargining {
    /// under this type of sub account margining, the respective sub account
    /// is margined along with all other sub accounts for a given master account
    /// this means that it's positions will influence the overall collateral ratio
    /// of the master account
    Cross,
    /// under this type of sub account margining, the respective sub account
    /// is margined in an isolated manner, which means that it's positions will
    /// not influence the overall collateral ratio of the master account
    Isolated,
}
```

### The First Vulnerability: Missing Update of Margining Mode

The **EditSubAccountMargining** instruction is used to change the margining mode for a specific sub-account. Here's the problematic handler code:

```rust
pub fn handler(
    ctx: Context<EditSubAccountMargining>,
    margining_type: SubAccountMargining,
) -> Result<()> {
    let clock = Clock::get()?;
    let clearing = ctx.accounts.clearing.load()?;
    let cache_account = ctx.accounts.cache_account.load()?;
    let mut master_account = ctx.accounts.master_account.load_mut()?;
    let mut sub_account = ctx.accounts.sub_account.load_mut()?;

    sub_account.margining_type = margining_type;

    let sub_account_idx = master_account
        .get_sub_account_idx(&ctx.accounts.sub_account.key())
        .unwrap();

    let (
        c_ratio,
        _volatile_c_ratio,
        assets_value,
        volatile_assets_value,
        liabilities_value,
        volatile_liabilities_value,
    ) = sub_account
        .get_margin_c_ratio_components(&cache_account, MarginCollateralRatioType::Initialization);

    master_account.update_account_cache(
        sub_account_idx,
        assets_value,
        volatile_assets_value,
        liabilities_value,
        volatile_liabilities_value,
        c_ratio,
        clock.slot,
    )?;

    master_account.updated_at = clock.slot;
    sub_account.updated_at = clock.slot;

    // if the sub account is margined in an isolated way we have to check c-ratios on the sub account itself
    if sub_account.margining_type == SubAccountMargining::Isolated {
        check!(
            c_ratio >= clearing.margin_init_ratio(),
            SubAccountCRatioBelowOptimal
        );
    } else {
        // check if any sub account has a stale price that would affect margin ratios
        for cache in master_account.sub_account_caches.iter() {
            if cache.margining == SubAccountMargining::Cross
                && cache.sub_account != Pubkey::default()
            {
                check!(
                    clock.slot - cache.updated_at <= ORACLE_PRICE_TTL_IN_SLOT,
                    StaleAccountCache
                );
            }
        }
        // otherwise the sub account is margined in a cross way so we check c-ratios on the master account
        let (c_ratio, _volatile_c_ratio) = master_account.get_margin_c_ratio();
        check!(
            c_ratio >= clearing.margin_init_ratio(),
            MasterAccountCRatioBelowOptimal
        );
    }

    emit!(SubAccountActionLog {
        master_account: ctx.accounts.master_account.key(),
        sub_account: ctx.accounts.sub_account.key(),
        authority: ctx.accounts.authority.key(),
        delegate: Pubkey::default(),
        margining_type: sub_account.margining_type,
        action: SubAccountAction::ChangeMarginingType,
    });
    Ok(())
}
```

The critical issue here is that while the sub-account's state is updated to reflect the new margining mode, the corresponding margining mode in the master account's cache of the sub-account is not updated. This creates a state where the sub-account is marked as isolated in its own data structure, but its cache in the master account still shows it as cross-collateralized.

This discrepancy means any master account with linked isolated margin sub-accounts enters a corrupted state, where there's inconsistency between the actual sub-account and its cached representation in the master account.

### The Second Vulnerability: Flawed Margin Checks

Every user-facing instruction that involves assets implements a **MarginChecksContext** trait. This trait includes the function that performs margin checks based on account data and collateral ratios. Here's the problematic code:

```rust
pub trait MarginChecksContext<'info> {
    fn clearing(&self) -> &AccountLoader<'info, Clearing>;
    fn cache_account(&self) -> &AccountLoader<'info, CacheAccount>;
    fn master_account(&self) -> &AccountLoader<'info, CypherAccount>;
    fn sub_account(&self) -> &AccountLoader<'info, CypherSubAccount>;

    /// performs margin checks
    ///
    /// if the sub account is margined in an isolated way we have to check the sub account's c-ratio
    ///
    /// if the sub account is not margined in an isolated way we will simply check the master account's c-ratio
    fn check_margin(
        &self,
        clearing: &Clearing,
        master_account: &CypherAccount,
        sub_account: &CypherSubAccount,
        pre_account_c_ratio: I80F48,
        pre_account_volatile_c_ratio: I80F48,
        pre_sub_account_c_ratio: I80F48,
        pre_sub_account_volatile_c_ratio: I80F48,
        post_sub_account_c_ratio: I80F48,
        post_sub_account_volatile_c_ratio: I80F48,
        did_borrow: bool,
    ) -> Result<()> {
        let clock = Clock::get()?;
        let margin_init_ratio = clearing.margin_init_ratio();

        // if the sub account is margined in an isolated way we have to check c-ratios on the sub account itself
        if sub_account.margining_type == SubAccountMargining::Isolated {
            #[cfg(not(feature = "mainnet-beta"))]
            msg!(
                "Sub Account - C-Ratio: {} | Volatile C-Ratio: {}",
                post_sub_account_c_ratio,
                post_sub_account_volatile_c_ratio
            );
            // if during this operation there was an increase in borrows we have to perform different checks
            // the idea here is to apply the different margin calculations which take into account volatile assets
            if did_borrow {
                // if the pre-c-ratio is already below init ratio, we need to check that the ratio improved
                if pre_sub_account_volatile_c_ratio <= margin_init_ratio {
                    check!(
                        post_sub_account_volatile_c_ratio >= pre_sub_account_volatile_c_ratio,
                        SubAccountCRatioBelowOptimal
                    );
                } else {

                    check!(
                        post_sub_account_volatile_c_ratio >= margin_init_ratio,
                        SubAccountCRatioBelowOptimal
                    );
                }
            } else {
                // if the pre-c-ratio is already below init ratio, we need to check that the ratio improved
                if pre_sub_account_c_ratio <= margin_init_ratio {
                    check!(
                        post_sub_account_c_ratio >= pre_sub_account_c_ratio,

                    );
                } else {

### Oracle Price Feeds and Volatility Calculation

The Cypher Protocol implemented concepts of "volatile assets" by merging multiple oracle price feeds (Pyth, Switchboard, and Chainlink) to produce a Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP). Bands were defined around this TWAP, and if an asset's instant price deviated outside these bands, it would be classified as volatile.

For borrowing operations, the protocol used two different collateral ratio calculations:

Standard collateral ratio:
```
c-ratio = assets / liabilities
```

Volatile collateral ratio:
```
volatile c-ratio = (assets - volatile assets) / (liabilities + volatile liabilities)
```

The critical vulnerability was in the margin check for isolated accounts during borrowing operations:

```rust
// if during this operation there was an increase in borrows we have to perform different checks
// the idea here is to apply the different margin calculations which take into account volatile assets
if did_borrow {
    // if the pre-c-ratio is already below init ratio, we need to check that the ratio improved
    if pre_sub_account_volatile_c_ratio <= margin_init_ratio {
        check!(
            post_sub_account_volatile_c_ratio >= pre_sub_account_volatile_c_ratio,
            SubAccountCRatioBelowOptimal
        );
    }
} else {
 //...
}
```

Because the merged oracle feeds had not yet been activated, both the pre-volatile and post-volatile collateral ratios were equal to zero when margin checks were performed. This, combined with the first vulnerability where the master account didn't properly track the isolated state of sub-accounts, allowed the attacker to borrow funds they shouldn't have been able to access.
